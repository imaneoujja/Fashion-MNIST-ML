## Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Introduction to Machine Learning** course. The objective was to implement various machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance on the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset, which consists of images of Zalando's articles. The project includes several machine learning methods, including deep learning models and principal component analysis (PCA).

## Implementation

This project implements the following methods:

- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Transformer model

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
  - Used to reduce dimensionality, specifically for the MLP model.

The main script (`main.py`) serves to execute these models on the dataset and evaluate their performance based on various metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset. The results and findings are detailed in the accompanying project report (report.pdf).
